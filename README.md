# Wine-datasets

Anyone who is actively engaged in the wine business knows how challenging it can be to keep up on all of the information needed to maintain a perspective on the marketplace.

Fortunately, thanks to data science, there are a few great tools that can make life easier by automating research and capturing web-based information that can be used in analysis

## Selenium
While Selenium is a tool that is typically used to automate browsers, it is also a very effective tool for web scraping, especially with websites that are built with javascript. The other characteristic that makes Selenium especially cool is that it’s automated features mimic human behavior as it scrolls through a web page to load all the links and then fetches the links of highest interest. It is also extremely helpful with sites that have an “infinite scroll”, such as a wine catalog that reloads as it nears the bottom of the page.
Based on your needs, there’s definitely a web scraper that you can harness within a python environment that can help you harvest the data you seek, so you can crush that data into the insights and observations that will impact your business.
